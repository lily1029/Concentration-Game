WELCOME!
This is a game called Concentration Game !

The object of the game is to find the a pair of matching pictures on the game board. Players can click every card. If two cards are matching, the game will use 400 million seconds to check if they are same or not. If they are same,
these two cards flip to blank cards. If they are not same, they will flip back to placeholder pics(Lego pics)

If the players find matching pictures, the game board will also update the how 
many matching scores the players made. The game board also accounts how many wrong guesses the players have made.
